		    <strong>The duck song</strong> <br>
		    By: Bryant Oden<br>
		    A duck walked up to a lemonade stand<br>
And he said to the man runnin' the stand<br>
"Hey! (bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"<br>
The man said: "No, we just sell lemonade<br>
But it's cold, and it's fresh, and it's all home-made!<br>
Can I get you a glass?"<br>
The duck said, "I'll pass."<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle<br>
'Til the very next day<br>
"Bom bom bom bom bom babom"<br>
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand<br>
And he said to the man runnin' the stand<br>
Hey! (bum bum bum), got any grapes?<br>
The man said: "No, like I said yesterday<br>
We just sell lemonade, okey?<br>
Why not give it a try?"<br>
The duck said. Good bye<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle<br>
'Til the very next day<br>
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand<br>
And he said to the man runnin' the stand<br>
"Hey! (bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"<br>
The man said: "Look, this is gettin' old<br>
I mean, lemonade's all we've ever sold<br>
Why not give it a go?"<br>
The duck said: "How about - no."<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle waddle<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle<br>
'Til the very next day<br>
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand<br>
And he said to the man runnin' the stand:<br>
"Hey! (bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"<br>
The man said: "That's it! If you don't stay away, duck<br>
I'll glue you to a tree and leave you there all day stuck!<br>
So don't get too close!<br>
The duck said, Adios<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle waddle<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle<br>
'Til the very next day<br>
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand<br>
And he said to the man runnin' the stand<br>
"Hey! (bum bum bum) Got any glue?"<br>
"What?" "Got any glue?" "No, why would I - oh..."<br>
"Then one more question for you:<br>
Got any grapes?"<br>
And the man just stopped<br>
The he started to smile<br>
He started to laugh<br>
He laughed for a while.<br>
He said: "Come on, duck<br>
Let's walk to the store<br>
I'll buy you some grapes<br>
So you don't have to ask anymore<br>
So they walked to the store<br>
And the man bought some grapes<br>
He gave one to the duck<br>
And the duck said: "Hmm, no thanks<br>
But you know what sounds good?<br>
It would make my day<br>
Do you think this store<br>
Do you think this store<br>
Do you think this store<br>
Has any lemonade?"<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle waddle<br>
Then he waddled away - waddle waddle<br>
